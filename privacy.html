                <summary>Access your Music Library</summary>
                <p>Bes Music normaly stores the downloaded Music in its app folder. So when the app is removed so is the
                    no longer used Music. You can instead choose to store the downloaded Files in your Music folder.
                    This allows you to store the Music on a different storage then the app (important for Mobile with
                    limited internal storage). In addition it will not be deleted on uninstall.</p>
