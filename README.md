# WP10-Music-Player

Since  OneDrive no longer Supports streaming, and Groove killed downloading of music and syncing playlistst the same time,
this is an alternative for Windows Mobile and Win 10. It downloads your Music from OneDrive and Syncing your Playlists.

I prefere having my Music always with me so it currently does not support streaming, but will download your music from OneDrive in advance.

It will need the latest Windows 10 Mobile Version. It ist Testet on an Lumia 950 DualSim and Win 10 1903.
